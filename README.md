# Mini Projects

This repository is mainly for projects that I have done out of curiosity, practice or learning.

I highly recommend open the notebooks using [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/) for a better display and interactions of the plots/charts found inside some notebooks

* [01 - Airline Passenger Satisfaction](https://github.com/Luis-Alat/mini_projects/blob/main/01_AirlinePassengerSatisfactionEDA.ipynb)

    Exploratory data analysis of passenger satisfaction data from kaggle

* [02 - Oxxo](https://github.com/Luis-Alat/mini_projects/tree/main/02_Oxxo)

    Obtaining and analyzing the distribution of oxxo stores in mexico city. This project consists of 4 files: data collection, data wrangling, outlier cleaning and analysis.
